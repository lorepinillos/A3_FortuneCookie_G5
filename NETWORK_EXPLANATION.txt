In our docker-compose.yml we do not explicitly define our subnet, 
but rather make our custom network my_custom_network_FC use the default Docker bridge driver. 
Because of this, Docker defaults to a private IP range like 172.17.0.0/16. 
In this case, this means that first 16 bits are the basenumber of our network : 
all containers in this network will always start with 172.17.0.0 
This address is not used as it is the base IP address of the network. 
Our gateway will be assigned 172.17.0.1, which is what we use for communicating with outside services. 
The highest number we can use is the one of our broadcast address 172.17.255.255, 
this is the one that network uses for specific function: connect all networks at same time. 
In conclusion, our IP ranges with first value 172.17.0.2 and last 172.17.255.254.

Should the subnet we use overlap with the host system’s network or with another Docker network, 
this could cause IP address conflicts, which would prevent containers from properly communicating 
with each other or with external resources.

Docker uses an internal DNS system to allow containers to refer to each other by their service name instead of IP addresses. 
This means that containers can use names (such as db or web, specified in the docker-compose.yml) 
and that Docker will resolve those names with the correct IP within the network.
