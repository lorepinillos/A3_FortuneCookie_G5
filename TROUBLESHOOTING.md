| Problem  | Cause | Solution |
|-------------|----------|-------------|
| Docker-compose not found | Docker Compose is not installed. |  Follow the [official Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) to install Docker Compose. Confirm installation with `docker-compose --version`. | 
| Port conflict | Another process is using the specified port (e.g., 5432 or 5500). | Edit the `.env` file to update `APP_PORT` to a free port (e.g., 5501). Restart Docker Compose with `docker-compose down` followed by `docker-compose up -d`. |                                          
| Unable to connect to database | Incorrect `DATABASE_URL`, missing or invalid credentials in `.env`, or database service not running. | Verify `docker-compose.yml` for correct `DATABASE_URL` and `db` configuration. Ensure `.env` contains valid credentials (`DATABASE_USER` and `DATABASE_PASSWORD`). Check `docker ps`. |
| Container fails to start or exit | Missing dependencies or a misconfigured Dockerfile.                                           | Check logs with `docker logs <container_id>` to identify the issue. Ensure all dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`. Rebuild and restart with `docker-compose build` and `docker-compose up -d`. |
| Flask service not accessible | Incorrect port mapping in `docker-compose.yml`.                                                | Confirm the `ports` section in `docker-compose.yml` is correctly mapped (e.g., `"5500:5000"`). Restart Docker Compose to apply changes.                                           |
| Ping fails between containers | Misconfigured networking or missing custom network.  | Create a custom network with `docker network create my_custom_network` and ensure itâ€™s specified in `docker-compose.yml`.                                                          |
| General debugging  | Configuration issues, service errors, or network misconfigurations. finfinn| Check running containers with `docker ps`. Inspect logs with `docker logs <container_id>`. Review network configurations with `docker network inspect my_custom_network`. Consult the [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/) for further help. |
